Simplest possible taboo game with Kids mode and General mode hosted on GithubPages. 

## The Story
One fine day my daughter played Taboo at her friends place and she loved it. We tried finding a good, kids friendly Taboo game with English words but it was difficult to find one. Some words were too complex for kids and many others were out of context.   

Next, we turned our attention towards online games and apps but again to our dismay, we ran into similar problems. Some close to our expectations were filled with annoying ads and click baits.    

This is when I decided to create this minimalistic version of the Taboo game, we have already played it mutiple times and then I finally decided to put it online for the people who might be facing similar constraints.    

Its minimalistic, its safe, it has kids friendly mode for simpler words, its ad & click-bait free and most of all, its super fun. Enjoy!!
